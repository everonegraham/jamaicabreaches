It has been reported that the JamCovid App, which was commissioned to the Amber Group by the Jamaica Ministry of Health, exposed personal data of travelers to Jamaica. This data seemed to be related to "Covid quarantine orders," which had contained travlers names and the address they were going to stay for the quarantine time period. Since the data was not password protected, it could have been found directly on the JamCovid App's website and could be accessed by anyone on the internet.
